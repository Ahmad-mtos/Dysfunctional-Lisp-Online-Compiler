# Description

Welcome to our website, where our goal is to introduce you to Dysfunctional Lisp, an untyped functional programming language. Through our interactive coding interface, you can explore Dysfunctional Lisp and experiment with it firsthand.

Dysfunctional Lisp is a reduced version of the Lisp programming language. It offers a lot of features, such as recursion, sequencing, mutability and many more. Programs in Dysfunctional Lisp consist of a sequence of function declarations. In addition to the language's core features, Dysfunctional Lisp provides a multitude of predefined functions that can be utilized. 

To get started, we recommend checking out the Tutorial section, which will guide you through the key concepts and help you begin your coding journey with Dysfunctional Lisp. For a deeper understanding of the language's structure, feel free to explore the Syntax page. Happy coding!
